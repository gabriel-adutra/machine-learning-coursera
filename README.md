This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 

* Supervised learning (parametric / nonparametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommendation systems, deep learning). 
* Best practices in machine learning (bias / variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

The course will also be based on several case studies and applications, so you will also learn how to apply learning algorithms to build intelligent robots (perception, control), text comprehension (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining and other areas.
